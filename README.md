# Touch Portal MuteMe Plugin

Integrates [MuteMe](https://muteme.com) into [Touch Portal](https://www.touch-portal.com)
You can control the color and mode. Send a notification to MuteMe and also setup a recurring color notification pattern.

The plugin will add three actions:

- Set MuteMe color and mode (static till next change)
- Signal MuteMe (one time flash)
- Set MuteMe notification (repeated flash)

and one Event:

- When MuteMe state changes (touched / untouched)

in addition a _MuteMe state_ value is added.
